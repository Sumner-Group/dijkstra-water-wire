# dijkstra-water-wire
This is a C / C++ program for Dijkstra's single source shortest
path algorithm. The program is for adjacency matrix
representation of the graph.
taken from http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printing-paths-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/ .
The code has been modified to calculate water wires connecting a donor and acceptor from an MD simulation.
Currently, only Amber MD has been tested and the code can use either a pdb trajectory file 
or an Amber ASCII trajectory file (mdcrd).
